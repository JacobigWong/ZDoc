# Per-monitor DPI awareness sample

This sample uses DPI Awareness APIs to show how to implement basic application functionality for a per-monitor DPI aware application. This includes operations like scaling a window, selecting new fonts, and re-rendering the window's content when the window moves to a monitor with a different DPI.

**Note** This sample has been superseded by the
[Per-window DPI awareness sample](../DPIAwarenessPerWindow).
